# Distributed Systems - Web Server

A distributor server as an middleware between client and server.

## Getting Started

Our initial motivation was to create a PWA mini-player using Spotify data, with a search area for artists or songs and a 30-second 'player'. Think about rendering HTML pages from two distributed servers, and using a distributor server as middleware between client and server.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
nodejs >= 10.0
npm or yarn
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
- Download the project
- npm install or yarn install
- npm run dev or yarn run dev in the distributed server, server A and server B
```
