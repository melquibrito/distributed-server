# Distributed Web Server - Prototype
This is a prototype of a distributed web server built with [Node js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) alongside Node js Framework [Express](http://expressjs.com/) with the purpose of demonstrating how a web server may be distributed internally.

## Architecture
We have built three distinct web servers, distributed locally. __Server Distributer__ as the main server, being the one responsible for handling client requests and feching the files that are all distributed through the other two servers, __Server A__ and __Server B__.

This prototype project is entirely based on the distributed web server architecture illustrated down below.

## Getting Started
Our initial motivation was to create a PWA mini-player using Spotify data, with a search area for artists or songs and a 30-second 'player'. Think about rendering HTML pages from two distributed servers, and using a distributor server as middleware between client and server.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
nodejs >= 10.0
npm or yarn
```

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be
```
- Download the project
- npm install or yarn install
- npm run dev or yarn run dev in the distributed server, server A and server B
```

## Deployment
Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
